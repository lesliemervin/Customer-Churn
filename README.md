# Customer-Churn
Creating a classification models that will help classify whether or not a customer churned.

📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn. Customer churn, or attrition, refers to when a customer stops using a company's product or service. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them.

🔍 Project Overview
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify customers as either churned or retained.
Dataset: Contains customer behavior, demographic details, and subscription information.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
