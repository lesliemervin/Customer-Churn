# Customer-Churn
Creating a classification models that will help classify whether or not a customer churned.

üìä Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn. Customer churn, or attrition, refers to when a customer stops using a company's product or service. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them.

üîç Project Overview
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify customers as either churned or retained.
Dataset: Contains customer behavior, demographic details, and subscription information.
Models Used: Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

üìÇ Key Files
customer_churn.csv/ - Contains the dataset (Link given).
Customer_Churn.py/ - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model development.
Accuracy Score- Trained models and evaluation results.
Scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
